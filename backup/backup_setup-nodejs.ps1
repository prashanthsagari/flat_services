.SYNOPSIS
    Sets up a Node.js app and MongoDB as a single-instance Kubernetes deployment inside Minikube.
.DESCRIPTION
    - Deletes any existing deployments and services for Node.js and MongoDB
    - Generates `node-deployment.yaml` and `mongo-deployment.yaml`
    - Builds the Node.js Docker image using Minikube's Docker
    - Deploys both Node.js and MongoDB into the Minikube cluster
.PARAMETER mongoUrl
    Not used anymore. MongoDB runs inside the cluster and service DNS is used.
